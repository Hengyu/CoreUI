# CoreUI

`CoreUI` package contains several targets for dedicated UI purposes.

Currently, we have two targets, they are:
1. AutumnUI;
2. SpringUI;

## AutumnUI

Contains a set of utility extensions of `UIKit`.

## SpringUI

Constains a set of generic UI components. 
Some of them may derived from trending codebase implemented by other creators.
